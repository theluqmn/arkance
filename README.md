# arkance

elevate your markdown-based jekyll sites

**arkance** is a jekyll template built to allow easy creation of quality markdown-based jekyll sites to deploy on [github pages](https://pages.github.com). customise it to your liking with the wide selection of includes available, if none of the layouts suits you.

## how to use

## how this works

## extras

the issues i encountered was designing the layouts for websites is tiring and repetitive, and the appearance is not consistent. to overcome this, i decided to work on a flexible template so that it suits every requirements, whilst saving time and ensuring the looks is standardised yet uniquely mine. most of my websites are hosted on github pages, and is built with jekyll anyway - so why not?
